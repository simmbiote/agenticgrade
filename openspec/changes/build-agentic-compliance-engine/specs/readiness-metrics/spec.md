## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Metric Catalog Structure

The system SHALL define a metrics catalog grouped into exactly six categories: Documentation, Architecture, Testing, Automation Guard Rails, AI Context, and Maintainability. Each metric in the catalog SHALL have a unique id, a category, a point value greater than zero, a human-readable description, an optional `provider` tag, and a detection rule that operates on a scanned repo file tree.

#### Scenario: Catalog covers all six categories

- **WHEN** the metrics catalog is loaded
- **THEN** it contains at least one metric for each of Documentation, Architecture, Testing, Automation Guard Rails, AI Context, and Maintainability

#### Scenario: Metric ids are unique

- **WHEN** the metrics catalog is loaded
- **THEN** no two metrics share the same id

### Requirement: Provider-Scoped Metrics

A metric MAY carry a `provider` tag with value `openspec`, `claude`, or `universal`. A metric with no `provider` tag is a base metric that applies to every scan regardless of detected providers (see `provider-detection`). A metric with a `provider` tag SHALL only be applicable — and therefore only counted in scoring — when that provider is present in the repo's detected provider set. Provider-scoped metrics are not restricted to the AI Context category; they MAY appear in any of the six categories.

#### Scenario: Base metric always applies

- **WHEN** a metric has no `provider` tag
- **THEN** it is evaluated and counted in every scan regardless of which providers are detected

#### Scenario: Provider-scoped metric applies when its provider is detected

- **WHEN** a metric is tagged `provider: openspec` and the repo's detected provider set includes `openspec`
- **THEN** the metric is evaluated and counted toward both the earned and max score

#### Scenario: Provider-scoped metric is excluded when its provider is absent

- **WHEN** a metric is tagged `provider: claude` and the repo's detected provider set does not include `claude`
- **THEN** the metric is excluded entirely from scoring — it counts toward neither earned nor max points

#### Scenario: Provider-scoped metrics span multiple categories

- **WHEN** the catalog defines `provider: openspec` metrics in the Architecture, Automation Guard Rails, and Maintainability categories
- **THEN** each is evaluated independently within its own category whenever `openspec` is detected

### Requirement: Documentation Category Metrics

### Requirement: OpenSpec Provider Metrics

When `openspec` is in the detected provider set, the system SHALL evaluate OpenSpec-specific metrics spanning multiple categories: an Architecture metric for change-level design docs, an Automation Guard Rails metric for CI-enforced validation, and a Maintainability metric for archive hygiene.

### Requirement: Claude Provider Metrics

When `claude` is in the detected provider set, the system SHALL evaluate Claude-specific metrics spanning multiple categories: an Automation Guard Rails metric for configured hooks, a Maintainability metric for documented subagents/skills, and a Documentation metric for documented custom commands.

- **THEN** the "AGENTS.md has required sections" metric is marked passed

### Requirement: No-Provider Fallback Behavior

When the detected provider set is exactly `{ none }`, the system SHALL NOT evaluate any provider-scoped metric. Base AI Context metrics (e.g. "AI context file exists") still run and are expected to fail, reflecting that no dedicated agent-context file was found.

#### Scenario: No provider-scoped metrics run

- **WHEN** the detected provider set is `{ none }`
- **THEN** no `provider`-tagged metric is evaluated, and the AI Context category score reflects only base metrics
